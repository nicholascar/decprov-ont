# DecProv-O
The Decision Provenance ontology


## Introduction
This ontology is derived from the [W3C Decisions and Decision-Making Incubator Group](https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/decision/)'s Decision Ontology (DO) which can be found at <https://github.com/nicholascar/decision-o>. It has been aligned with the W3C's [PROV ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/) since it is widely recognised that analysing the elements of decisions *post hoc* is an exercise in provenance.
