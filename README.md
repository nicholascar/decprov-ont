# DecProv-O
The Decision/Provenance ontology


## Introduction
This ontology is a re-worked version of the [W3C Decisions and Decision-Making Incubator Group](https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/decision/)'s Decision Ontology (DO) which can be found at <https://github.com/nicholascar/decision-o>. It has been aligned with the W3C's [PROV ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/) since it is widely recognised that analysing the elements of decisions *post hoc* is an exercise in provenance.


## Background
This DO was published as an output of the [W3C Decisions and Decision-Making Incubator Group](https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/decision/) 
in 2012 as the [Sample Decision Ontology ](https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/decision/XGR-decision-20120417/Sample_Decision_Ontology.html). 
Since then the DO has been re-published at the link above in order to position it for continued development.  

The version of the DO published by the Incubator group will be referred to as the the DO, v1.0.  

This ontology will be refered to as the DecProv ontology.
